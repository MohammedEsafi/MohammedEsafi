### Hi, I'm Mohammed Esafi ðŸ‘‹

â€” a software engineer living in Morocco ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¦ experienced in building responsive, accessible websites and web applications using JavaScript, Dart and their ecosystem.

Interested in learning more about me! â€” [MY RESUME â€” SOON]()

---

ðŸ’¡ I'm currently exploring new opportunities and side projects.

ðŸŽ“ I'm a student at [1337](https://1337.ma/) where I learned about algorithms and AI on various C programming-related projects. 1337 is part of the international [42 network](https://www.42.fr/42-network). The 42 pedagogy is based on learning by building projects and peer-review. That helped me gain experience in building modern web applications, defending my code, and working in a team.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on contributing to JS based projects and mentoring.

ðŸ“« How to reach me :: [hello@mesafi.com](mailto:hello@mesafi.com)! I'll try to respond as soon as I can.
